[![Discord Bots](https://discordbots.org/api/widget/460663266541043712.svg)](https://discordbots.org/bot/460663266541043712)

A multipurpose helpful bot with human interaction, top news, quotes, stock / crypto prices and charts, polls.

To activate this bot, mention it or use !c or .c .

Chloe is a Discord bot by Weijing Wang and Kyler Chin.

Type ```!c help``` in the chat to get help

Swearing is prohibited under this bot.

## Commands

Commands must be prefixed with `!Chloe`. See below for examples.

### `price`

Use the `price` command to fetch stats from CoinMarketCap.

```
!Chloe price btc
!Chloe price stellar
!Chloe price nano
```

### `convert`

Converts `to` in to `from`.

```
!Chloe convert 10 btc nano
!Chloe convert 10 ada eth
```

### `balance`

Returns the balance of the given Wallet. Currently supported currencies:

- `btc`
- `eth`
- `tokens` (Returns all ERC-20 Tokens)

```
!Chloe balance btc 15urYnyeJe3gwbGJ74wcX89Tz7ZtsFDVew
!Chloe balance tokens 0x57d90b64a1a57749b0f932f1a3395792e12e7055
```

### `top`

Returns the top `gainers`/`losers` for the given period. Valid periods:

- `1h`
- `24h`
- `7d`

```
!Chloe top gainers 1h
!Chloe top losers 7d
```

### `poll`

Creates a new Poll for people to vote on. Has very configurable options.

Specifying a Poll that has no options will add the üëç and üëé reactions for people to use:

```
!Chloe poll Is the sky blue?
```

You can specify up to 10 options on new lines:

```
!Chloe poll Which is your favourite animal?
Dog
Cat
Mouse
```

The above will give each option a letter of the alphabet, e.g. `A`, `B` and `C`, for the reactions. If you want to specify your own emojis for each option, you can do so:

```
!Chloe poll Which is your favourite animal?
üê∂) Dog
üê±) Cat
üê≠) Mouse
```

You can also negate the text altogether and use just emojis:

```
!Chloe poll Which is your favourite animal?
üê∂
üê±
üê≠
```

It is also possible to mix-and-max these options:

```
!Chloe poll Which is your favourite animal?
Dog
üê±) Cat
üê≠
```

**Note:** Whilst you can use custom emojis, please only use custom emojis from the server you're posting the poll in, otherwise it's unlikely the Bot will find them.

### `prefix`

Changes the Bot Prefix for this Server.

**Note:** Only the Server Owner can do this.

For example, using the following:

```
!Chloe prefix .
```

Would mean that instead of `!Chloe price btc` you would use `.price btc`.

If you want to end your prefix with a blank space (Such as the default `!Chloe ` prefix), replace the space with `[space]`. E.g.:

```
!Chloe prefix !Chloe[space]
```

### `stats`

Print out statistical information about the current Server.

```
!Chloe stats
```

### `flip`

Flips a coin. That's all.

```
!Chloe flip
```

### `dice`

```
!Chloe dice
```

### `ping`

```
!Chloe ping
```

### `info`

Prints out Info text for the Bot. E.g.

```
!Chloe info
```

### `help`

```
!Chloe help
!Chloe help price
```

## Development

### Requirements

- PostgreSQL
- NodeJS (8+)

### Environment Variables

## Instructions

Dependencies: NodeJS LTS or better, NPM

To install the package dependencies, use ```npm install```

Chloe uses `dotenv` for Env Var management. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and use the guide below to fill out the variables:

- `DISCORD_TOKEN` - Your Discord Bot Token, found [here](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me).
- `DISCORDBOTS_TOKEN` [Optional] - Your DiscordBots.org API Key, used to inform DiscordBots of the Server Count.
- `ETHPLORER_TOKEN` - Your Ethplorer.io API Key. This can be left as `freekey`.
- `BUGSNAG_API_KEY` [Optional] - Your Bugsnag API Key for error reporting.
- `COMMAND_PREFIX` - The prefix that all Commands must be prefixed with.
- `CRYPTO_UPDATE_INTERVAL` - The milliseconds between querying CMC for new Cryptocurrencies.
- `INFO_UPDATE_INTERVAL` - The milliseconds between querying CMC for all market data.
- `STATS_PERSIST_INTERVAL` - The milliseconds between persisting the collected Statistical data.
- `POSTGRESQL_*` - Your PostgreSQL config.

First, get a discord bot token for the API here: https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc/wiki/Creating-a-discord-bot-&-getting-a-token. Then edit the file .env and paste in your token under the "token".

### Migrations

Chloe uses Migrations to make sure Database Integrity is maintained. Before developing with Chloe, you'll want to make sure you run the migrations via the following command:

```
npm run migrate
```

Additionally, this command should be run after every deployment to make sure your Database is up-to-date.

### Seeders

If it is your first time setting up Chloe, you'll need to run the Database Seeders to populate the Database with the initial data.

```
npm run seed
```

**ENJOY!!! :)**
